<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthuasiastic Egyptian Web Developer and Civil Engineer.</p>

<p>
  As a Pharoh descendant, i grew passion and curiosity about buildings and
  construction.So i studied and became a civil engineer. Later on i became more
  curious about the web and how it function because computers and internet are
  amazing. So a civil Engineer by day and a web developer by night. Both jobs
  requires perscision and problem solving .

<p>
  As anEgyptian, I'm deeply rooted in a rich history of engineering and
  innovation. i apply that heritage to my work as a civil engineer and a
  developer as well, bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms. I
  strive to contribute in the advancment and evolution of both fields in Egypt
  and all around the world.
